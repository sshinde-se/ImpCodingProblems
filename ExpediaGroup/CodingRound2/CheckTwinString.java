/**

 Two strings, a and b, are said to be twins only if they can be made equivalent by performing some number of operations on one or both strings. There are two possible operations:

 SwapEven: Swap a character at an even-numbered index with a character at another even-numbered index.

 SwapOdd: Swap a character at an odd-numbered index with a character at another odd-numbered index.

 For example,
 a = "abcdfe"

 a c=> cbadfe
 a f=> cbfdae


 b = "cdabef"

 d b => cbadef
 a e => cbedaf


 a

 output=  twins
 because we can make them equivalent by performing operations.

 a = "abcd"
 b = "bcda"
 output =  not twins
